## Introduction

Welcome to the Infodeck.io Developer Documentation!
This guide will help you get started with integrating our platform into your projects and accessing our APIs

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An Infodeck.io developer account. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up [here](https://app.infodeck.io).
- Basic knowledge of web development and RESTful APIs.
 
### API Integration

If you prefer direct API integration, you can make HTTP requests to our endpoints. Refer to our [API documentation](/docs/rest/api) for  detailed information on endpoints, parameters, and responses.

Happy coding!
